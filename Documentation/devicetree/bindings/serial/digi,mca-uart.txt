* Digi MCA UART device tree bindings

The MCA UART driver exposes extra TTY devices through the Micro Controller
Assistant. These UARTs can be used to wake the system from low power modes.
Notice the MCA UART has limited capabilities compared to CPU's UARTs.
Check the documentation for a list of capabilities.

Required properties:
- compatible: must be one of
  "digi,mca-cc6ul-uart".
	      cc6ul requires MCA version 1.19 or higher.
- #address-cells: must be 1
- #size-cells: must be 0

Subcomponents:

Required properties:
- reg: UART base address
- index: UART index
- iopins-names: "rx", "tx". Optionally also "cts", "rts".
- iopins: the MCA I/O pins associated to 'iopins-names'.
	  NOTE: Not all I/O pins can be used for any functionality on any UART.
	  Refer to the documentation to map appropriate pins and functions.


Example:

mca_uart: uart {
	compatible = "digi,mca-cc6ul-uart";
	#address-cells = <1>;
	#size-cells = <0>;

	mca_uart0: serial@0x900 {
		reg = <0x900>;
		index = <0>;
		iopins-names = "rx", "tx";
		iopins = <2 1>;
	};
};
